## My process

This was a challenging challenge. The most tricky one that I've done so far of the Frontend Mentor challenges.
I started by identifying which elements would share the same property in order for me to write cleaner and more efficient code.
Then worked my way from left to write, focusing on the elements first on the left container and then working on the elements within the right container.
Small issues and challenges came up but were easily solvable. Once I got the summary container is where I faced my first real challenge. Although the styling was pretty straightforward, working out the HTML was a bit confusing as I struggled to figure out what was the best way to make it manageable.

The next challenge I faced was being able to make it responsive which took a bit of tweaking but managed to solve it quite simply with a change of a few properties.

Overall this was a fun and challenging task of which I enjoyed working through.
